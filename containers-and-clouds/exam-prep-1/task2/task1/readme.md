# Task 2: Deploy ASP.NET Core MVC app to Azure via Terraform

For this task, I deployed a .NET application consisting of two projects (web application and SQL Server database) to Azure using Terraform. The deployment was configured using four Terraform files:

1. `main.tf`
2. `variables.tf`
3. `values.tfvars`
4. `outputs.tf`

## Deliverables

- Terraform configuration files
- Screenshot of the deployed application
