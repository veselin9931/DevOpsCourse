# Containers and Cloud Exam Preparation

This repository contains my solutions for the exam preparation problems for the "Containers and Cloud" course at SoftUni. The project is divided into three main tasks:

1. Deploying a NodeJS app to Azure
2. Deploying an ASP.NET Core MVC app to Azure via Terraform
3. Setting up App Monitoring (BONUS)

Each task is located in its respective folder with a detailed README explaining the implementation and deliverables.

## Important Note

## Technologies Used

- Azure App Service
- Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB
- Terraform
- Prometheus

For more information on each task, please refer to the README files in the respective folders.
